# metro-resilience-od-flow
This is the repository related to the paper **Resilient Urban Public Transportation Infrastructure: A Comparison of Five Flow-Weighted Metro Networks in terms of the Resilience Cycle Framework**, preprint link: https://doi.org/10.1109/tits.2021.3116667.

To conduct the analysis with the example data, find and run the main.py.  

Codes covering the resilience cycle framework are in the xc_resilience.py.

We also provide details in data collection of Origin-Destination flows from publicly available datasets (Data_Collection_Information.docx).
