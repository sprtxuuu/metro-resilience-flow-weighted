# metro-resilience-od-flow
This is the repository for the paper **Resilient Urban Public Transportation Infrastructure: A Comparison of Five Flow-Weighted Metro Networks in terms of the Resilience Cycle Framework**, link: .

To conduct the analysis with the example data, find and run the main.py.  

Codes covering the resilience cycle framework are in the xc_resilience.py.

We also provide details in data collections of Origin-Destination flow from publicly available datasets (Data_Collection_Information.docx).
